This Hello Spring 2 example demonstrates how to use Maven and Spring. With IntelliJ IDEA, we don't have to download and install Maven but it is integrated into the IDE. Very handy, right?

What is Maven? 
Basically, Maven is a build tool that help us to download neccessary libraries, build our source code to jar or war.
To use Maven we have to create a pom.xml file and a project structure: src/main/java
In fact, if we use Intellij IDEA to create a Maven project, we don't have to do all these boilerplate stuff

Spring
Spring is very common now so everyone know that Spring is a Inversion of Control container or Dependency Injection framework. If that sounds too much complicated, let think about Spring as a tool that help us create new object without using the keyword new. Because we don't have to create new object, we don't have to set any member objects but Spring will also take care of that.

As the setting of member classes is moved away from our code, it is believed that our code is more readable and easier to maintain. Someone calls it as loosely couple.
